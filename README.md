# Kirby Air Ride - Stat AutoCounter

This is a component for LiveSplit. Move the .dll file into the folder LiveSplit/Components/.

Currently, this component is written only for **Dolphin 5.0 Stable**. If you wish to use this with a different version of Dolphin Emulator, you will have to find the base pointer for that version using Cheat Engine, and then replace the value in the .asl file.

In some cases, you may need to change the stats base pointer for your system as well, which you can find using Dolphin Memory Engine.
